## Multithreaded indexing for Annoy (version 1.17 or later)
## requires this define to be set
# USE_MULTITTHREADING=-DANNOYLIB_MULTITHREADED_BUILD
## and also requires C++14 for std::shared_timed_mutex
CXX_STD = CXX17
## So to use multithreaded indexing, comment out the setting above
## Note that it may alter your result (or their order) slightly due
## to the use of multithreading which alters the sequence of RNG draws

PKG_CPPFLAGS = -I../inst/include/ ${USE_MULTITTHREADING}
